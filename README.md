# Birdy

A program and database for counting birds in your garden, balcony, terrace, ... !

Birdy can be used as a helper tool for the yearly birds census in Austria (*Stunde der Winterv√∂gel* https://birdlife.at).

Usually the bird counting takes place beginning of the year (long after the leaves are fallen from the trees...).

**Following functionalities are included:**
* Define a duration and insert your bird sightings (species and number).

Happy bird counting!
